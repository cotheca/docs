# Contributing
The Cotheca Docs are a repository of organizational resources that establishes the practices we follow for anything within the Cotheca Project. You can adopt these practices, or even better, you can contribute to them, too.

Just like any other Open Source project, contributions are always welcome and a Pull Request is all it takes. It doesn't matter if it's just a grammar correction, a fix for a typo, or a new methodology. Let's build this together!

**Note**: The process described in this CONTRIBUTING.md not only applies to the [@cotheca/docs](https://github.com/cotheca/docs) repository, but it is the general contributing process for all Cotheca projects.

Here's a quick guide to get started:

 1. **Make sure to understand what the Cotheca project is trying to achieve**.
Learn [what Cotheca is](./COTHECA.md) and what its overall goal is, so we are always on the same page. Feel free to reach out to clear any questions or inquiries about the project.

 2. **Check out the Development Board**.
	 The [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/cotheca/projects/2/views/1?pane=info) contains all of the issues for all of our repositories, which include new feature requests, bug reports, pull requests.

	You might want to check out the board's [Unassigned view](https://github.com/orgs/cotheca/projects/2/views/10?pane=info) to pick your next contributing adventure!

 3. **Follow the repository's objectives**.
	Each project (or product) has its own independent objectives and live in its own repository  (some dependencies might exist across projects, though). So, you can choose to either jump into an existing issue (an unassigned task from the [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/cotheca/projects/2/views/10)), or create a new issue to suggest anything new that you would like to work on.

 4. **Fork and Branch out**.
 Once you have figured out the issue that you want to work on, follow this steps:
 
	1. Fork the repository that you want to contribute to. This is your own copy of the repository.
	2.  Create a branch (in your forked) following the
`<keyword>-<issue number>-<description in PascalCase>`
convention, like:
	- feature-101-SomethingNew
	- bug-101-DescribeWhatsBroken
	- wip-101-DescribesNeitherAFeatureOrABug

	View the [**contributing** section](./contributing) for more details.

 5. **Submit your Pull Request** (PR).
	Make sure to read the documents in the [**contributing** section](./contributing) prior to submitting a PR, since this will accelerate your contribution into the code base.

	Once received, your PR will be peer-reviewed, and if everything looks good, your code will make it into Quality Assurance, and eventually into an upcoming release.
