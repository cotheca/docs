# Contributing
Let's build this together! Here's a quick guide to get started:

 1. **Make sure to understand what the Cotheca project is trying to achieve**.
Learn [what Cotheca is](./COTHECA.md) and what its overall goal is, so we are always on the same page. Feel free to reach out to clear any questions or inquiries about the project.
 2. **Check out the Development Board**.
Basically the [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/cotheca/projects/2) helps keeping the project on track towards completing milestones.
View the [**development** section](./development) for more details.
 3. **Follow the repository's objectives**.
Each project (or product) has its own independent objectives and live in its own repository  (some dependencies might exist across projects, though). So, you can choose to either jump into an existing issue (unassigned task from the [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/cotheca/projects/2)), or create a new issue to suggest a feature or anything new that you would like to work on.
View the [**contributing** section](./contributing) for more details.
 4. **Fork/Branch out**.
Create your local branch following the
`<keyword>-<issue number>-<description in PascalCase>`
convention, like:
	- feature-101-SomethingNew
	- bug-101-DescribeWhatsBroken
	- wip-101-DescribesNeitherAFeatureOrABug
View the [**contributing** section](./contributing) for more details.
 5. **Submit your Pull Request** (PR).
Make sure to read the Style Guide, Contributing and Development documents prior to submitting a PR, since this will accelerate your contribution into the code base.
Once received, your PR will be peer-reviewed, and if everything looks good, your code will make it into Quality Assurance, and eventually into an upcoming release.
