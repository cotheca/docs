# Global Practices
The main objective for the Cotheca project - as a whole - is to help streamline software development regardless of the environment, the programming language or even what the end-product is about by providing a global solution for common needs on most software products.

In order to achieve this ambitious objective, we need to pursue and apply several principles from software engineering and data modeling. This *Global Practices* document describes the principles used, how are they used and in which development stage they are used.

## The Big Picture for Practices
The goal of these Global Practices document is to establish a written context and guidelines upon which Cotheca (and its contributors) build universal sharable and interchangeable software libraries for all, so that everyone interested is on the same page and can understand the broad applications of the Cotheca products (code libraries) simply by following, revising or suggesting updates to these practices:
 - Software authors can understand what's the aggregated value of using Cotheca libraries in their products.
 - Cotheca Contributors can have a written reference on how to build these libraries and solutions together in an organized and efficient way, so their efforts are successfully apply to our supply chain.
 - Cotheca could channel an important percentage of the individual coding efforts from all adopters from their independent endeavors into a common public code base.

## Core Principles and Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming (FP)
- Abstraction
- Data Normalization
- Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Composition
- Code Interoperability
